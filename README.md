# curatorial-note
This is an audio-video project dealing with curation of Kochi Biennale 2016. 
It is experimental in nature and a student work. 

Few important points:
1. It is a critique on the importance of text in the process of curation of artwork, questioning if at times, the text overpowers a work itself.
2. Instead of talking about individual project curation, it brings into light the curatorial note, which acts as an umbrella for every art work within the biennale.
3. Web interaction is the video component of this work. Clicking on a word blocks the word and generates a "pixel/point" of color. This can be used as a drawing tool in almost a stencil format, limited by what the text arrangement permits.
4. There is also a sonification associated with this text, where the text in an algorithmic fashion generates a music piece.
5. Together, this becomes both a critique and a work on its own.
